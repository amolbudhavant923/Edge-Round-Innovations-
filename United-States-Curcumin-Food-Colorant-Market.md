This segment primarily uses curcumin as a natural coloring agent in products such as beverages, snacks, dairy items, baked goods, and confectionery. The increasing consumer preference for natural and organic ingredients has significantly contributed to the rise of curcumin-based colorants in food products. Curcumin provides a vibrant yellow to orange color, making it a popular choice for a variety of food products while also aligning with the growing trend towards clean labels and minimal ingredient lists in the food sector. Moreover, curcumin is perceived as a healthier alternative to synthetic colorants, appealing to health-conscious consumers who are increasingly concerned about the potential adverse effects of artificial additives. Additionally, as consumers seek transparency in food production and opt for items that feature minimal chemical additives, the demand for natural food colorants like curcumin is expected to increase. The food industry’s growing shift toward natural solutions is reflected in the adoption of curcumin not just for coloring purposes, but also for its functional health benefits. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of curcumin further enhance its appeal to food manufacturers who are developing products aimed at boosting health and wellness.

In this sector, curcumin is primarily used in products such as skincare creams, lotions, soaps, shampoos, and cosmetics. Curcumin’s natural coloring and antioxidant properties make it an attractive ingredient for manufacturers seeking to create beauty and personal care products that appeal to health-conscious consumers. The growing demand for natural and organic beauty products has driven the adoption of curcumin as a key ingredient, especially in the formulation of products that promote skin health. Curcumin’s anti-inflammatory and anti-aging benefits are particularly sought after in skincare products, where it is used to address issues such as redness, inflammation, and skin irritation. Furthermore, the use of curcumin in personal care products aligns with the rising consumer trend towards clean, green, and ethical beauty. As consumers continue to seek personal care items free from synthetic chemicals, parabens, and artificial dyes, curcumin’s role as a natural colorant that also offers functional benefits is likely to expand. Personal care brands that position themselves around sustainability and health-conscious formulations are increasingly incorporating curcumin into their products.
