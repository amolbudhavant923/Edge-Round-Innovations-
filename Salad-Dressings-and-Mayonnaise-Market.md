Additionally, the increasing trend of home cooking and the convenience of ready-to-use salad dressings and mayonnaise products have played a significant role in boosting the market. Furthermore, online retail platforms have enhanced consumer access to a wider range of specialty and premium products, leading to an uptick in sales.
